# Tower of hanoi
In this project, I created a program that solves a puzzle known as tower of hanoi. The rule of the puzzle is simple, you have to move the tower made up of disks from A to C but the larger disks can not be placed on top of the smaller disks at any time.

## How to run
To run this code, you have to enter the number of disks you want to play with and click on the make move button to play. If you don't put any number, it'll start with default 5 disks.

## Things to improve in the future
I'd like to make it an actual puzzle that users can interact. I want users to actually play this puzzle themselves. I'd also like to work on the styling.
